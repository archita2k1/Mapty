# Mapty
The goal of this application is to log your workout. 
Select the location on the map where you want to work out then on the form where you can input your workout, in the sidebar, fill the details then the info gets logged in the location.
You can also log multiple workouts in different locations.
The application allows you to log cycling (Elev Gain, meters) and running workouts (Cadence, steps/min).
